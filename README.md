About
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? 
Coffee that you don't have to make yourself. It is enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you will get a cup of energy; but first we have to teach the machine how to do it. In this project, I worked on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can order three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and latte. Since nothing is given for free, he also collects money.
The project was written in Kotlin.
